        <p> Use cases:<br/>
            ● Schools could use our management system to handle attendance,
            assignments, quizzes etc. This would solve a potential problem since
            most schools don't use a management system right now.<br/>
            ● Announcements/Home section which will keep students informed about the
            tests and other events that take place.<br/>
            ● Exclusive Conversations App that can be used to discuss academic 
            related queries and also to share the notes. Each class can have its own group.<br/>
            ● Hassle Free online fee payment along with fee receipt issued
            instantly after fee payment.<br/>
            ● Submission of assignments by eliminating redundant tasks of
            entering the student details for submission of each assignment.<br/>
            ● Look for the availability of library books online.<br/>
